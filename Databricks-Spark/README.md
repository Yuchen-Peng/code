# Databricks

Databricks is a managed platform for running Apache Spark. 

## Terminologies:

 - **Workspace**: to save **notebooks** and libraries
 - **Notebook**: to hold cells of code to be executed; including `%[language name]` in the beginning to specify the code in each cell (one can specify a default language when creating a notebook). 
 Notebook reads data from **table**, and needs to be connected to **clusters** to be executed.
 - **Table**: to store data for **notebook** to read, usually in S3.
 - **Clusters**: set of computers to execute code from **notebook** on **table**.
